## Prompt 1 — App Screens (6 polished screens)

Generate **6 high-fidelity UI mockups** for the KBs Football Network app. Style: premium dark theme, FIFA/FC25 career-mode inspired but original. No copyrighted FIFA assets.

**Global style for all 6:**
- Background: deep navy to midnight blue gradient.
- Cards/panels: dark charcoal with subtle glassmorphism (frosted glass, soft blur).
- Accents: metallic gold for buttons, badges, and key UI elements; subtle gold glow on hover states.
- Typography: clean, modern sans-serif; white and ice gray for text; gold for highlights and labels.

- Include the **KB shield logo** in the top-left of each app screen as the brand mark.

**Screens to generate:**

1. **Landing page (desktop)**  
   Hero section with headline about connecting players, coaches, and clubs. Three role cards: Player, Coach, Club. Deep navy background, gold CTA buttons. KB logo top-left. Trust strip or “How it works” section. Premium, sport-tech feel.

2. **Discovery — Player cards grid (desktop)**  
   Grid of FIFA-style player cards: each card shows photo (or placeholder), position badge, age, current club/region, and a rating number in a gold circular badge. Cards are dark glass panels with soft shadow; one card has a subtle gold border/hover glow. Top: search bar, filter chips, “Players | Coaches | Clubs | Jobs” tabs. KB logo in header. Navy background.

3. **Discovery — Mobile view**  
   Single column of two stacked player cards (same FIFA-style: photo, position, age, club, rating badge). Dark glass cards on navy. Top: compact header with KB logo and menu. Bottom: simple tab bar or nav. Clean, thumb-friendly.

4. **Club dashboard — Applicant pipeline (desktop)**  
   Kanban-style board: columns “New”, “Reviewed”, “Shortlisted”, “Interview”, “Offer”, “Closed”. Each column has 1–2 applicant cards (avatar, name, role). Cards are dark panels; column headers in gold or white. Sidebar or top bar with KB logo. Navy background, professional recruitment vibe.

5. **Messaging — Chat view (desktop or mobile)**  
   Left: conversation list (2–3 rows with avatar, name, last message preview). Right (or full screen on mobile): active chat with message bubbles—sent messages with gold tint, received with dark glass; timestamps. Header with KB logo and contact name. Navy background, clean and minimal.

6. **Profile detail — Player (desktop)**  
   Large profile header: player photo, name, position, age, nationality, rating in gold badge. Below: sections for stats, club, availability, languages in dark glass panels. Sidebar or bottom: “Message” and “Save” buttons in gold. Subtle KB logo watermark in corner. Premium, career-mode style but original.

**Output:** 6 separate images, 16:9 or 4:3 for app screens; label each (Landing, Discovery desktop, Discovery mobile, Pipeline, Chat, Profile).
